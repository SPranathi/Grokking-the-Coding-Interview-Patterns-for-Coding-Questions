/*
Problem Statement #

Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the ‘K’ largest numbers in it.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 3
Output: [5, 12, 11] 

Time complexity #

As discussed above, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(K*logK+(N-K)*logK), which is asymptotically equal to O(N*logK)
Space complexity #

The space complexity will be O(K)O(K)O(K) since we need to store the top ‘K’ numbers in the heap.
